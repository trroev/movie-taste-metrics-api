# MOVIE TASTE METRICS API

This API is a personalized movie recommendation system that utilizes data analysis to generate a list of suggested films for users based on their viewing history and preferences. It is able to process requests from the front-end, such as receiving user data and returning recommended movies. The API also allows for updating and storing user preferences for future recommendations. To generate the recommendations, it utilizes TMDb's API, which provides a vast amount of information about movies. Overall, this API serves as the backbone for a movie recommendation app, providing the necessary data and functionality for a seamless user experience.
